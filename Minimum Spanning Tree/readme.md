This is based on a reported coding interview question from a Google interview. 

Specification
There are n cities that want to create a shared train network so that each pair of cities is connected by rail to each of the other cities. The cost of laying track is directly proportional to the distance between two cities. The cost to lay one mile of railroad track is $1M. Your task is to determine the lowest cost possible for laying the track so that all the cities are connected. 

Input
A single line containing the number n of cities followed by n city coordinate lines. Each of the coordinate lines is a pair of floating point numbers x y giving the coordinates of the cities on a square grid (for this problem you may assume the earth is flat and that the units of the grid structure are given in miles). 

Output
The minimum amount of money (in millions) that must be spent to create the railroad network.   You can round this to a single decimal place.
